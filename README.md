Sudan Humanitarian Aid Analysis: Data Exploration & Visualization
This GitHub repository contains code for analyzing and visualizing data related to humanitarian aid for Sudan and other countries.

## 1. Project Background/Context:

This project investigates the relationship between the number of displaced people in a country and the UN budget allocated for humanitarian aid. It also explores how media mentions and trade volumes influence these factors.

## 2. Executive Summary:

The code utilizes pandas and matplotlib libraries to process and visualize data from various sources. Key functionalities include:

Creating scatter plots to explore the relationship between displaced people and budget allocation.
Incorporating country flags as data point markers for enhanced visualization.
Analyzing media mentions of Sudan, Ukraine, and Gaza over time.
Merging and visualizing data on media mentions by country for different news outlets.
Examining trade data between African countries and the UAE. (Note: Data paths reference user's local machine and need adjustment)

## 3. Insights Deep Dive:

The scatter plots provide a preliminary view of the correlation between displaced people and budget allocation. Further analysis might involve statistical tests for stronger evidence.
Visualizing media mentions can reveal periods of increased public attention towards specific humanitarian crises.
Examining media outlets covering these crises can offer insights into the media landscape and potential biases.
Trade data (if relevant to the specific crisis) can be used to understand economic factors influencing humanitarian needs.

## Additional Notes:

The code currently uses file paths specific to the user's machine and needs adjustments for broader use.
Error messages are present due to undefined variables resulting from missing data merges. These can be addressed by ensuring successful data merging before plotting the visualizations.
I hope this summary clarifies the project's goals and the functionalities of the code.
